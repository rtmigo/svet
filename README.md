# [vien](https://github.com/rtmigo/vien_py#readme)

**VIEN** is a command-line tool for
managing [Python Virtual Environments](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).

It provides one-line shortcuts for:

- creating and deleting environments
- running commands inside environments
- switching between environments in bash shell

-----

Switching between projects should be simple. Creating environments for the projects should be simple
too.

Ideally it's a short command that I would type even half asleep.

Something like

``` bash
$ vien create 
$ vien shell
```

Not like

``` bash
$ python3 -m venv ./where/to/put/this/.venv
$ source /i/lost/that/.venv/bin/activate
```

<details>
  <summary>Ready-made solutions did not help.</summary><br/>

- [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/) kind of solved the problem, but brought new challenges unrelated
  to virtual environments
- [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/) name is easier to copy-paste than
  to type. And its commands are too

</details>

So there is the `vien`. A tool for a half asleep developer.

# Install

<details>
  <summary>Get a working Python â‰¥3.7, pip3 and venv.</summary><br/>

@ Ubuntu

``` bash
$ sudo apt install -y python3 python3-pip python3-venv
```

@ macOS

``` bash
$ brew install python3
```

Check it works

``` bash
$ python3 --version             # python shows its version
$ python3 -m venv --help        # venv shows help message
$ pip3 install --upgrade pip    # pip upgrades itself
```

----
</details>

Then:

``` bash
$ pip3 install vien
```

Make sure it installed:

``` bash
$ vien      # shows help
```

Upgrade it later:

``` bash
$ pip3 install vien --upgrade
```

# Use

## Create a virtual environment

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/myProject
$ vien create 
```

By default `vien` will try to use `python3` as the interpreter for the virtual environment.

<details>
  <summary>If you have 
more than one Python version, provide one more argument.</summary><br/>
Point to the proper interpreter the way you execute it.

If you execute scripts like that

``` bash
$ python3.8 /path/to/script.py
```

Create virtual environment like that:

``` bash
$ vien create python3.8
```

Or provide full path to the interpreter:

``` bash
$ vien create /usr/local/opt/python@3.8/bin/python3
```

</details>

## Dive into interactive bash

```bash	
$ cd /path/to/myProject
$ vien shell

(myProject)$ _
```

Now you are inside the virtual environment.

```bash	
(myProject)$ which python3             # now we are using separate copy of Python
(myProject)$ echo $PATH                # everything is slightly different

(myProject)$ pip3 install requests     # installs packages into virtual environment
(myProject)$ python3 use_requests.py   # runs inside the virtual environment
```

Get out of the virtual environment:

```bash
(myProject)$ exit

$ _
```

Now you're back.

## Run a script inside the virtual environment

It is `vien run <any bash command>`

```bash 		
$ cd /path/to/myProject
$ vien run python3 use_requests.py arg1 arg2  # runs in virtual environment
$ vien run pip3 install requests              # installs packages into virtual environment
```

<details>
  <summary>is an equivalent to</summary><br/>

```bash 		
$ cd /path/to/myProject

$ source /path/to/the/venv/bin/activate
$ python3 use_requests.py arg1 arg2
$ /path/to/the/venv/bin/deactivate

$ source /path/to/the/venv/bin/activate
$ pip3 install requests
$ /path/to/the/venv/bin/deactivate
```

</details>

# Where are those virtual environments

`vien` offers a simple rule of where to keep the environments.

|project dir|virtual environment dir|
|-----|----|
|`/abc/thisProject`|`$HOME/.vien/thisProject_venv`|
|`/abc/otherProject`|`$HOME/.vien/otherProject_venv`|
|`/moved/to/otherProject`|`$HOME/.vien/otherProject_venv`|

So only the local name of the project directory matters. And all the virtual environments are
in `$HOME/.vien`.

If you're not happy with the default, you can set the environment variable `VIENDIR`:

``` bash
$ export VIENDIR="/x/y/z"
```

So for the project `aaa` the virtual environment will be located in `/x/y/z/aaa_venv`.

The `_venv` suffix tells the utility that this directory can be safely removed.

# Other commands

### Delete virtual environment

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/myProject
$ vien delete 
```

### Delete old and create new virtual environment

Useful, when you want to start from scratch.

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/myProject
$ vien recreate 
```

Or upgrade it from an old Python to a new one:

``` bash
$ cd /path/to/myProject
$ vien recreate /usr/local/opt/python@3.10/bin/python3
```

# Shell prompt

By default the `vien shell` adds a prefix to
the [`$PS1`](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bash/Prompt_customization)
bash prompt.

``` bash
user@host$ cd /abc/myProject
user@host$ vien shell

(myProject)user@host$ _
```

So you can see, which virtual environment you're using.

If you customized your `PS1`, it may not work as expected.

``` bash
personalized:prompt> cd /abc/myProject
personalized:prompt> vien shell

(myProject)user@host$ _
```

It can be fixed by providing `PS1` variable to `vien` like that:

``` bash
personalized:prompt> cd /abc/myProject
personalized:prompt> PS1=$PS1 vien shell

(myProject)personalized:prompt> _
```

To avoid doing this each time, `export` your `PS1` to make it available for
subprocesses.

# Shebang

Add the following line to the top of `main.py`

```
#!/usr/bin/env vien run python
```

Make the main.py executable

``` bash
$ chmod +x main.py  
```

Now you can run the `main.py` directly from command line. In will use the `vien`
virtual environment associated with the parent directory of `main.py`.

``` bash
$ /path/to/myProject/main.py
```

Of course, the virtual environment must be initialized if it is not already done

``` bash
$ cd /abc/myProject
$ vien create
$ vien shell
$ pip install ...
```
